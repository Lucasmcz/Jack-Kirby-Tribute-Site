            <h2>Sobre os Anos iniciais de Jack Kirby</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Jack KING Kirby </span> (born August 28, 1917, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 6, 1994, Thousand Oaks, California) 
                was an American comic book artist who helped create hundreds of original characters,
                 including Captain America, the Incredible Hulk, and the Fantastic Four.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Jack KING Kirby</span> left high school at age 16 and worked in Max Fleischer animation studio on Betty Boop and Popeye cartoons
                before teaming up with fellow artist Joe Simon in 1941. Working for Timely (later Marvel) Comics,
                the pair created Captain America, a star-spangled super-soldier who quickly became the publishers most popular character.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Jack KING Kirby</span> and Simon collaborated on a number of titles over the following years, exploring the crime, horror, and humour genres, and they created the first romance comic in 1947. 
                <span class="bold">Jack KING Kirby</span> and Simons professional relationship was strained by the challenges of working in an increasingly competitive and uncertain market, and by 1956 the team had drifted apart.
                <span class="bold">Jack KING Kirby</span> responded by turning to newspaper comic strips, and his Sky Masters of the Space Force was a moderate success.
